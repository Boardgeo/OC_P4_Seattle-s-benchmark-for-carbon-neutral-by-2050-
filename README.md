# OC_P4_Seattle-s-benchmark-for-carbon-neutral-by-2050

## Context
 - The City of Seattle's benchmark policy is to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from existing buildings and achieve a zero net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. To achieve this goal, careful surveys of the energy consumption, gas emissions, and building properties (such as size, number of floors, parking etc) were conducted by city staff in 2016 and made available at https://data.seattle.gov/dataset/2016-Building-Energy-Benchmarking/2bpz-gwpy. However, these surveys are expensive to obtain, and from the ones already done, they want to try to predict the CO2 emissions and total energy consumption of non-housing buildings for which they have not yet been measured. 
 
 
 ## Task
 - To achieve this goal, I am looking closely look at the documented consumption and emissions data of non-housing buildings in the City of Seattle to predict the CO2 emissions and total energy consumption of non-residential buildings that have not yet been measured.
 - I will also evaluate and integrate the value of the "ENERGY STAR Score" for emissions prediction, which is tedious to calculate with the approach currently used.
